# Lee–Wick Field Analysis (Mathematica)

This repository contains Mathematica codes to study the interaction between a point-like charge and a mirror in the Lee–Wick (Podolsky-type) scalar field model.  

The program calculates the **energy** and the **force** as functions of the distance \(a\) and of the mass parameters \((M,\mu)\). It also performs a **stability analysis** by diagonalizing the fluctuation operator and identifying when the system becomes unstable.

## Main Features
- **Energy and force evaluation**: computes the integrals and their derivatives.  
- **Parameter scans**: loops over values of \(a, M, \mu\) and produces tables or plots.  
- **Frequentist fitting**: finds the best parameters by minimizing a chi-squared function against reference data.  
- **Stability check**: diagonalizes a matrix and flags if eigenvalues indicate instability.  
- **Data export**: results can be saved as CSV files or images for publication.
