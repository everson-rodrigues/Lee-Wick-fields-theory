# Lee–Wick Field Analysis (Mathematica)

This repository contains Mathematica codes to study the interaction between a point-like charge and a mirror in the Lee–Wick (Podolsky-type) scalar field model.  

The program calculates the **energy** and the **force** as functions of the distance \(a\) and of the mass parameters \((M,\mu)\). It also performs a **stability analysis** by diagonalizing the fluctuation operator and identifying when the system becomes unstable.

## Main Features
- **Energy and force evaluation**: computes the integrals and their derivatives.  
- **Parameter scans**: loops over values of \(a, M, \mu\) and produces tables or plots.  
- **Frequentist fitting**: finds the best parameters by minimizing a chi-squared function against reference data.  
- **Stability check**: diagonalizes a matrix and flags if eigenvalues indicate instability.  
- **Data export**: results can be saved as CSV files or images for publication.

The code shows how analytical models combined with parameter estimation can be implemented in a reproducible way. While here it is applied to theoretical physics, the same workflow—defining a model, scanning parameters, fitting them to data, and checking stability—can be directly transferred to the business world. For example, companies often build models of customer behavior or financial risk: the energy corresponds to a cost function, the force to its derivative (trend), and the stability analysis to identifying when the system is no longer sustainable. This makes the skills and logic developed here highly valuable for data-driven decision making in business contexts.
